name: Karachi AQI Feature Pipeline

# Automated feature engineering pipeline for Karachi AQI prediction system
# - Runs hourly to process newly collected raw data
    # - Stores engineered features in MongoDB
    # This is a cosmetic change to trigger GitHub Actions re-indexing.

on:
  schedule:
    # Run feature engineering every hour, shortly after data collection
    # (e.g., 5 minutes after the hour to allow data collection to finish)
    - cron: '5 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggering
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
    paths:
