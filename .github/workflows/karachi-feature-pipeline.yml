# Automated feature engineering pipeline for Karachi AQI prediction system
# - Runs hourly to process newly collected raw data
# - Stores engineered features in MySQL
# This workflow processes raw data into features.
# Cosmetic change to trigger workflow re-indexing

on:
  schedule:
    # Run feature engineering every hour, shortly after data collection
    # (e.g., 5 minutes after the hour to allow data collection to finish)
    - cron: '5 * * * *'
